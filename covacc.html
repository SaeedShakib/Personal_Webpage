    <h1>Investigating the Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Perception of Residential Accessibility in Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area</h1>
</br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
</br>
    <p>Since the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (1), various research projects around the world have investigated the mobility impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (2â€“7). Efforts and focus have been dedicated to comprehending the early influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel behaviour to explore changes in travel demand (4,7), ridership changes of travel modes (6,7), and network traffic congestion (2,3,5). Mobility-oriented approaches have so far received the most attention in seeking the transportation impacts of COVID-19. At the same time, fewer studies focus on the lasting effects of households' COVID-19 pandemic experience on accessibility aspects of urban areas. In other words, at the point that this paper is being written, it is ambiguous as to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic will change households' perceived accessibility of their residence. </p>
